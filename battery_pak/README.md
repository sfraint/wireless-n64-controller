## Battery Pak
This was designed with FreeCAD version 0.19.

The battery pak assembly used in this project is made up of three pieces:

1. Terminal block - this is the small piece that stays in the pak-port of the controller

2. Pak rounded side

3. Pak square side - this side has a cutout for the micro USB charging port, charging circuitry, wiring, and terminals; it snaps together with the rounded side

The pak itself contains a lithium polymer battery, charging circuitry, and battery terminals.

I've put both `.step` and `.stl` files in subdirectories here. The 3d models are also on [thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5028827).

### Ordering

It is relatively cheap to print a part like this if you or a friend have a 3d printer, otherwise you're going to have to pay a shop (and likely pay for shipping), which makes the battery "pak" one of the most expensive pieces in this project.

If you do have to order from a shop, there are a lot online that will print and ship these parts for < $20.
