## Ordering a PCB

Since this project uses a custom PCB, you'll need to order it from a PCB manufacturer.

This process is pretty simple, you just need to select a manufacturer, upload the appropriate file, and order it. In this directory I've added a `.kicad_pcb` file as well as a `gerber.zip` file, one of which should be sufficient for most PCB manufacturers.

### Manufacturers

There are a ton of manufacturers out there that will print custom PCBs. I can't really offer a comprehensive guide here for selecting a manufacturer - and I encourage you to do some research on your own.

However, I have used a couple different companies in the past, which worked out fine:

1. OSH Park - good, US-based manufacturer
  They're quick, professional, and easy-to-use, though relatively expensive for large boards like this.

2. JLCPCB - Chinese manufacturer
  I have only used them once, and things turned out fine. Much cheaper for large boards. They use lower quality materials/processes than Osh Park, but that shouldn't matter much for a project like this.
